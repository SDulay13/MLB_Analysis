## **Introduction**

The dynamics of baseball have long fascinated analysts and enthusiasts,
with statistical metrics playing a pivotal role in understanding and
predicting team performance. Over the past decade, advanced analytics
have provided great insights into hitting, pitching, and fielding,
reshaping how teams approach the game strategically. This study dives
into how specific metrics influence success. Understanding the nuances
of these metrics and structural changes is not only valuable for team
management but also for fans and stakeholders who wish to engage more
deeply with the sport. The findings from this study can influence
roster-building decisions, tactical approaches, and even broadcasting
narratives, making baseball analytics accessible and impactful across
various domains.

By combining statistical rigor with domain-specific knowledge, this
study seeks to fill the gap between traditional baseball insights and
modern predictive techniques.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Data Description and Source**

**Data Description**

The dataset utilized for this study includes a comprehensive range of
hitting, pitching, and fielding metrics, both cumulative and average
from [https://www.baseball-reference.com](baseball-reference.com) .
These variables cover traditional statistics, such as home runs and
earned run average (ERA), alongside advanced metrics like exit velocity
(EV) and defensive runs saved (RDRS). To ensure interpretability, some
metrics have been normalized where appropriate, enabling consistent
comparisons across teams. The dataset is structured as panel data
spanning ten years, with teams as entities and seasons as time periods.
This structure allows for the inclusion of fixed effects to account for
team-specific and time-specific variations.

**Data Source**

The primary source of data is
[https://www.baseball-reference.com](Baseball%20Reference), an
open-access database renowned for its reliability and extensive coverage
of baseball statistics. Baseball Reference actively updates its metrics,
offering downloadable CSV files for specific categories,
including:\newline

-   Standard Pitching
-   Advanced Pitching
-   Standard Batting
-   Advanced Batting
-   Fielding

The CSV files for each category were loaded and merged year by year to
form a cohesive dataset covering the 2015â€“2024 MLB seasons.

The decision to use Baseball Reference stems from its robust
documentation and ease of accessibility. Additionally, its
standardization of historical metrics ensures compatibility across
years, which is crucial for longitudinal studies like this.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Our initial analysis focuses on understanding the variability in key
metrics. The following variables are of interest:\newline - **SB:**
Stolen Bases Percentage \newline - **PAge:** Average Pitcher
Age\newline - **BatAge:** Average Batter Age\newline - **EV:** Average
Exit Velocity\newline - **ERA:** Earned Run Average\newline - **BB:**
Bases on Balls\newline - **OPS:** On-base Percentage Plus
Slugging\newline - **HR:** Home Run Percentage\newline - **RS:** Runner
Support Percentage\newline - **E:** Errors Committed\newline - **RDRS:**
Defensive Runs Saved\newline

Each variable is numeric with no missing values, allowing for robust
statistical analysis. Spread measures like standard deviation (SD) and
interquartile range (IQR) help quantify league variability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Data Cleaning and Transformation:

```{r}
mlb$RS. <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", mlb$RS.))
mlb$BB. <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", mlb$BB.))
colnames(mlb)[104] <- "HR_bat"
mlb$HR_percentage <- mlb$HR_bat / mlb$AB
mlb$SB. <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", mlb$SB.))
```

Summary statistics for each variable:

```{r}
columns <- c("SB", "PAge", "BatAge", "EV", "ERA", "BB.", "OPS", "HR_percentage", "RS.", 
             "E", "Rdrs")

for (col in columns) {
  cat("Statistics for column:", col, "\n")
  column_data <- mlb[[col]]
  
  cat("- Number of non-missing observations:", sum(!is.na(column_data)), "\n")
  cat("- Number of missing observations:", sum(is.na(column_data)), "\n")
  cat("- Mean:", mean(column_data, na.rm = TRUE), "\n")
  cat("- Median:", median(column_data, na.rm = TRUE), "\n")
  cat("- Standard Deviation:", sd(column_data, na.rm = TRUE), "\n")
  cat("- IQR:", IQR(column_data, na.rm = TRUE), "\n\n")
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Binary Playoff Variable**

To facilitate our analysis, we coded a binary variable, `playoffs`,
indicating whether a team made the playoffs (1) or not (0). This
variable accounts for playoff format changes and adjusts for variations
across seasons.

```{r}
#Coding binary variable for whether or not team reached the playoffs
# potential to add teams that just missed playoffs in original years in order to train model for current playoff structure

mlb$playoffs <- ifelse(
 ( (mlb$Tm %in% c("Kansas City Royals", "Toronto Blue Jays", "New York Yankees", "Texas Rangers", 
                  "Houston Astros", "St. Louis Cardinals", "Los Angeles Dodgers", "New York Mets",

    ,1,0)
mlb$playoffs <- as.factor(mlb$playoffs)
```

## **Visualizations**

##### **Playoff Format Changes**

A bar chart was created to depict how the playoff format has evolved
over time, specifically focusing on the percentage of teams qualifying
for the postseason.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
playoff_teams <- c(10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 16, 10, 12, 12, 12)
teams <- c(30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30)

playoff_percent <- (playoff_teams / teams) * 100

seasons <- 2015:2024

playoff_percent <- data.frame(
  season = seasons,
  playoff_percent = playoff_percent
)

ggplot(playoff_percent, aes(x = factor(season), y = playoff_percent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of Teams Making Playoffs (2015-2024)",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Playoff Percentage"
  ) 
```

#### Analysis for Bar Plot:

The bar plot illustrates the percentage of teams making the playoffs
across the seasons from 2015 to 2024. It highlights significant changes
in playoff formats:

1.  **Consistency (2015â€“2019, 2021)**: The percentage remains stable at
    around 33%, indicating a fixed format of 10 playoff teams out of 30.
2.  **COVID-19 Impact (2020)**: The percentage spikes to over 50%,
    showing the temporary expansion of playoff teams to 16, offering a
    unique case for further statistical exploration.
3.  **Post-2021 Expansion**: From 2022 onward, the percentage increases
    to 40%, reflecting the introduction of a 12-team playoff format.
    This change creates an exogenous factor suitable for
    quasi-experimental studies on team success under differing
    constraints.

Key takeaway: The structural changes in playoff eligibility
significantly affect team dynamics and strategy, offering a natural
experiment to analyze how changes in competitive incentives impact
performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### **Comparing Playoff vs. Non-Playoff Teams**

Boxplots were generated to compare playoff and non-playoff teams across
several predictors, revealing systematic differences between these
groups.

```{r}

par(mfrow = c(1, 3))


plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$SB., xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "Stolen Base %") 
plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$PAge, xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "Average Pitcher Age")
plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$BatAge, xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "Average Batter Age")
plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$EV, xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "Average Exit Velocity") 
plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$ERA, xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "ERA")

colnames(mlb)[108] <- "BB_bat"
plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$BB_bat, xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "Bases on Balls/Walks %")

colnames(mlb)[113] <- "OPS_bat"
plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$OPS_bat, xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "On-base Plus Slugging")

plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$HR_percentage, xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "Home Run %") 
plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$RS., xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "RS%")
plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$E, xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "Errors Committed")
plot(mlb$playoffs, mlb$Rdrs, xlab = "Made Playoffs", ylab = "Defensive Runs Saved")

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))


```

#### Analysis for Boxplots:

The boxplots compare various predictors for teams that made the playoffs
(1) versus those that did not (0):

#### **1. Stolen Base Percentage (SB%)**\newline

-   **Observation**: Teams that made the playoffs generally have a
    higher median stolen base percentage, indicating the value of
    aggressive base running in successful team strategies.
-   **Insight**: This metric could be explored further to determine its
    role in offensive efficiency and run production.

#### **2. Pitcher and Batter Average Ages (PAge, BatAge)**

-   **Observation**: Playoff teams have slightly older average pitcher
    and batter ages, suggesting experience might play a role in team
    success.
-   **Insight**: Analyzing whether these age differences are
    statistically significant could reveal if veteran players contribute
    to key metrics such as ERA or OPS.

#### **3. Average Exit Velocity (EV)**

-   **Observation**: Higher average exit velocity among playoff teams
    highlights the importance of hitting power and quality of contact.
-   **Insight**: Including EV as a predictor in models could better
    explain offensive success rates.

#### **4. Earned Run Average (ERA)**

-   **Observation**: Playoff teams show lower ERA, underscoring pitching
    quality as a crucial determinant of success.
-   **Insight**: Future analyses can evaluate the correlation between
    ERA and playoff advancement.

#### **5. Bases on Balls Percentage (BB%)**

-   **Observation**: Higher median BB% for playoff teams suggests plate
    discipline and drawing walks are correlated with success.
-   **Insight**: Combining this with metrics like OBP could refine
    understanding of offensive strategies.

#### **6. On-Base Plus Slugging (OPS)**

-   **Observation**: Playoff teams exhibit higher OPS, reinforcing the
    idea that teams with better offensive efficiency have greater
    success.
-   **Insight**: OPS could be broken into its components to identify
    whether on-base ability or power-hitting has a stronger impact.

#### **7. Home Run Percentage (HR%)**

-   **Observation**: Playoff teams have a slightly higher HR%,
    indicating the influence of power hitting.
-   **Insight**: This metricâ€™s interaction with factors like pitching
    and fielding could reveal its true significance.

#### **8. Runner Support Percentage (RS%)**

-   **Observation**: Higher RS% in playoff teams aligns with the
    importance of converting baserunners into runs.
-   **Insight**: Decomposing RS% by situations (e.g., runners in scoring
    position) might offer additional granularity.

#### **9. Errors Committed (E)**

-   **Observation**: Lower error rates in playoff teams highlight the
    role of defensive consistency.
-   **Insight**: Including advanced fielding metrics like DefEff could
    add predictive power to models.

#### **10. Defensive Runs Saved (Rdrs)**

-   **Observation**: Positive Rdrs values for playoff teams underscore
    the importance of defensive contributions.
-   **Insight**: Examining this in tandem with pitching metrics like
    WHIP might reveal how defense mitigates run production by opponents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### General Observations:

The boxplots collectively emphasize the multidimensional nature of
success in MLB, encompassing pitching, hitting, running, and defense.
The insights suggest avenues for more nuanced predictive modeling,
particularly through interaction terms and stratified analyses.
Incorporating these metrics into linear or logistic regression models
will likely improve predictive accuracy for playoff qualification and
postseason success.

## **Hypothesis Testing**

#### **Introduction**

This section examines the impact of Intentional Bases on Balls (IBBs) on
a team's Win-Loss percentage. The inquiry stems from the decision by
pitchers to intentionally walk strong power hitters to reduce the risk
of conceding home runs. The objective is to determine whether this
strategy negatively affects a team's Win-Loss percentage by potentially
disrupting offensive output. Conversely, it is plausible that teams with
high IBB rates capitalize on these intentional walks, turning them into
an advantage. Additionally, having high IBB is likely positively
correlated with Home Runs.

#### **Measurement Approach**

To normalize across teams and control for differences in plate
appearances, IBB is measured as a proportion of IBB to At Bats
$(\text{IBB}/\text{AB}) \times 100$. This representation captures
intentional walks as a function of offensive opportunities.

#### **Model Adjustments**

Team and season fixed effects were incorporated to control for factors
varying across teams and seasons. These include:

-   **Seasonal Dynamics**: Factors like rule changes or shortened
    seasons (e.g., 2020 during COVID).
-   **Team-Level Constraints**: Budgetary limitations or offensive
    strength variations.

In a second model, **On-Base Percentage (OBP)** and **Runs Allowed per
Game (RA/G)** were added as control variables. OBP accounts for
offensive strength and the likelihood of intentional walks, while RA/G
represents defensive performance. Together, these adjustments ensure the
analysis isolates the relationship between IBB and team performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Interpretations**

#### **Model 1 Results**

$$
\hat{\beta_0} = 0.404, \quad \hat{\beta_1} = 0.112
$$

The coefficient for IBB ($\hat{\beta_1}$) is $0.112$, with a p-value of
$0.00016$, indicating statistical significance at $\alpha = 0.05$. This
suggests that, on average, an increase in IBB/AB by one percentage point
corresponds to a $0.112$ increase in Win-Loss percentage. The null
hypothesis is rejected, demonstrating that intentional walks positively
impact Win-Loss percentage. It implies that intentional walks are
indicative of strong hitters contributing to offensive opportunities
rather than disrupting offensive flow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Model 2 Results**

$$
\hat{\beta_0} = 1.124, \quad \hat{\beta_1} = 0.031, \quad \hat{\beta_2} = -0.005, \quad \hat{\beta_3} = -0.114
$$

After including OBP and RA/G as controls, the coefficient for IBB
($\hat{\beta_1}$) becomes statistically insignificant ($p = 0.10$).
Similarly, the coefficient for OBP ($\hat{\beta_2}$) is also
statistically insignificant ($p = 0.28$) and unexpectedly negative.
While this contradicts the intuitive expectation that stronger offensive
performance (measured by OBP) should positively correlate with higher
Win-Loss proportions, it is likely influenced by multicollinearity, as
players with higher OBP are often intentionally walked more frequently.
This overlap may obscure OBP's unique contribution to Win-Loss
proportions. The coefficient for RA/G ($\hat{\beta_3}$) is negative and
significant ($p = 5.33e-15$), in line with our understanding that teams
better at preventing runs generally achieve higher Win-Loss proportions.
This result suggests that IBB's impact is mediated by defensive factors,
and reflects a team's overall strength rather than directly driving
performance. It also suggests that a team's defensive strength might be
a stronger predictor of Win-Loss proportion than offensive metrics such
as IBB or OBP, emphasizing the importance of run prevention in team
success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Contextual Analysis**

The effects of IBB are context-dependent and influenced by game states,
lineups, and high-leverage situations. For example:

-   **Scenario 1**: An intentional walk with two outs and empty bases in
    the 1st inning.
-   **Scenario 2**: An intentional walk with no outs, bases loaded in
    the 9th inning.

These differing contexts highlight the situational role of IBB, which
may not consistently affect season-long performance metrics.
Furthermore, IBB often reflects an opponent's strategy and defensive
quality rather than the team's intrinsic performance.

This nuanced understanding underscores the importance of contextual
analysis in interpreting the broader implications of intentional walks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Discussion on Playoff Format Change**

The MLB expanded its postseason from 10 to 12 teams in 2022. This rule
change is not only exciting for fans, as their teams should be in the
hunt for a playoff spot each season, but the change should also be
welcomed by statisticians. The exogenous rule change provides a setting
for a quasi-random study where the performance of the two additional
teams that now make the playoffs can be studied. This will allow
inference on whether there are systematic differences between what it
takes to win to get into the playoffs and the World Series. Over the
past three seasons, fans have had the luxury of watching more frequent
upsets. While there are different theories on why lower-seeded teams
outperform their opponents in the playoffs, we will set up a statistical
framework for testing the unexpected high-quality play of the 11th and
12th seeds.

#### **Comparison of Playoff Formats**

Before we dive into the statistical framework, we will clarify how the
playoffs work now versus how they did in the Wild Card era, which was
the previous format. From 2012â€“2019 and in 2021, the playoffs consisted
of ten teams. There were six division winners split across the American
and National Leagues. Then, each league had two Wild Card teams that did
not win their division but held the best records in their league out of
non-division-winning teams. Each leagueâ€™s two Wild Card teams played
each other in a win-or-go-home match. The winner would go on to play in
the Division Series against the division winner with the best record,
and the other two division winners would play each other. The two teams
to win the Division Series would go on to play in the League
Championship Series. The winner of each leagueâ€™s championship would meet
in the World Series. The Division Series was a best-of-five, with the
exception of 2012, which was a best-of-three. The League Championship
Series and World Series were both best-of-sevens.

The most recent playoffs of the 10-team format are depicted below:

![The most recent playoffs of the 10-team format via
MLB.com](/cloud/project/Screenshot%202024-12-20%20094054.jpg)

Now, the stakes are different. An additional team makes the playoffs in
each league, where the division winner with the lowest record now
participates against the lowest Wild Card team in a best-of-three, and
the top two Wild Card teams play each other in a three-game series as
well. The top two division winners maintain their guaranteed spot in the
Division Series. The other rounds remain the same. For a visual of the
new format, refer to the image below:

![The most recent playoffs of the 12-team format via
MLB.com](/cloud/project/Screenshot%202024-12-20%20094727.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Analysis of Changes and Implications**

In the previous format, which consists of nine seasons, three teams made
the World Series, and two ended up winning the World Series as well. In
2014, the Kansas City Royals and San Francisco Giants were both Wild
Card teams that met in the World Series, with the Giants winning. In
2019, the Washington Nationals won the World Series as a Wild Card. In
the new format, we have already seen Wild Card teams make or even win
the World Series in just three seasons. \newline

-   In 2022, the Phillies were not only a Wild Card team but also the
    lowest-ranked team in the National League. Without this change, they
    would not have made the playoffs, let alone the World Series.
    \newline

-   In 2023, two Wild Card teams clashed in the World Series, one of
    which was the lowest seed in the National Leagueâ€”the Arizona
    Diamondbacksâ€”who were eliminated by the 5th seed in the American
    League, the Texas Rangers. \newline

In these three seasons, three out of the six teams to make a World
Series were Wild Card teams, two of which were the 6th seeds that would
not have made it in the prior format.

With the miraculous runs witnessed in two of the past three seasons, it
is reasonable to expect more, leading to the question: Why are teams
that performed better all season losing to teams that would not have
even made the playoffs? For the 6th seed to advance to the World Series,
they must beat the division winners with the best and worst records,
with the former being heavy favorites usually.

This happened two times in the first three seasons under this format and
creates a setting to study how to build a team that can make the
playoffs, rise above expectations, and consistently beat the best of the
best.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Framework for Analysis**

The expanded playoff format provides an opportunity to study whether
lower-seeded teams consistently outperform expectations. The following
linear model can quantify this:

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1Post_i + \beta_2SixSeed_i + \beta_3(Post_i \times SixSeed_i) + \epsilon_i$$

Where: - $Y_i$ is the outcome of interest (e.g., number of playoff games
won, World Series appearances). - $Post_i$ is an indicator variable for
the new format (1 for 2022 onward, 0 for prior years). - $SixSeed_i$ is
an indicator variable for the lowest-seeded playoff teams (1 for 6th
seed, 0 otherwise). - $Post_i \times SixSeed_i$ captures the interaction
between format and seeding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Conditional Expectations**

-   Teams with 1stâ€“5th seeds in the prior format:
    $E(Y_i | Post_i=0, SixSeed_i=0) = \beta_0$
-   Teams with 1stâ€“5th seeds in the current format:
    $E(Y_i | Post_i=1, SixSeed_i=0) = \beta_0 + \beta_1$
-   Teams with 6th seeds in the prior format (hypothetical):
    $E(Y_i | Post_i=0, SixSeed_i=1) = \beta_0 + \beta_2$
-   Teams with 6th seeds in the current format:
    $E(Y_i | Post_i=1, SixSeed_i=1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$

This model allows us to test whether the expanded format
disproportionately benefits lower-seeded teams.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Potential Analysis**

While the current sample size (2022â€“2024) is small, the model could
expand in future seasons to analyze: - Series wins by seed under each
format. - Upset likelihood (lower seed defeating higher seed). -
Systematic differences in team characteristics (e.g., budget, player
metrics).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Prediction for 2025**

This section focuses on predicting which teams will make the playoffs in
2025 using a combination of common baseball statistics and
regularization techniques. The primary goal is to test whether select
predictors can accurately forecast playoff outcomes through statistical
modeling and machine learning.

#### **Baseline Model**

We began with a probit model to predict playoff appearances based on a
set of predefined predictors. This baseline model leverages substantive
knowledge to identify metrics strongly associated with team success. The
accuracy of this model will be evaluated using cross-validation
techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, and compared to machine
learning methods like LASSO and ridge regression.

#### **Model Assumptions**

-   **Team Playoff Indicator:**\
    Let $Playoff_i$ represent a binary indicator for the $i$-th team,
    taking the value 1 if the team makes the playoffs and 0 otherwise.
    Playoff qualification is used as a proxy for team success, aligning
    with MLB teamsâ€™ overarching goal of winning the World Series.\
-   **Constraints:**\
    The model is limited to 30 observations per year over ten years,
    necessitating a small model to avoid overfitting. Additionally, the
    study period includes a playoff expansion, which complicates the
    constraints on qualifying teams.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Initial Model Specification**

The baseline model includes a mixture of predictors representing pitcher
and hitter success, drawn from standard and advanced metrics:

$$
P(Playoff_i=1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 SB + \beta_2 PAge + \beta_3 BatAge + \beta_4 EV + \beta_5 ERA + \beta_6 BB + \beta_7 OPS + \beta_8 HR + \beta_9 RS + \beta_{10} E + \beta_{11} RDRS
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Hypothesis of Interest**

The hypothesis posits that a teamâ€™s playoff likelihood can be accurately
predicted using a select group of metrics. These metrics may include
unconventional statistics that are overlooked by analysts and fans. The
analysis focuses on both:

-   **Predictive Accuracy:**\
    Measured by cross-validation techniques and root mean square
    prediction error (RMSPE).\
-   **Variable Significance:**\
    Tested using formal hypothesis testing for individual coefficients.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### **Baseline Model**

The baseline model is fitted using predictors derived from substantive
knowledge. Preliminary analysis of playoff versus non-playoff teams
revealed systemic differences in their statistical profiles.

```{r}

normalized_mlb <- mlb
predictors <- c("SB", "PAge", "BatAge", "EV", "ERA", "BB", "OPS", 
                "HR", "RS.", "E", "Rdrs")
normalized_mlb[predictors] <- scale(mlb[predictors])

# fit model
summary(logit <- glm(playoffs ~ SB + PAge + BatAge + EV + ERA + BB + 
                       OPS + HR + RS. + E + Rdrs,
                     data = normalized_mlb, family = "binomial"))$coefficients
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Model Comparison and Validation**

To compare the baseline model with regularization techniques like ridge
and LASSO regression, we computed the RMSPE. The analysis also
considered principal component analysis (PCA) to maximize the explained
variance with fewer predictors.

**Baseline Model Validation with k-Fold Cross-Validation:**

```{r}
library(dplyr)

k <- 10
set.seed(139)

mlb_logit <- normalized_mlb %>%
  select("SB", "PAge", "BatAge", "EV", "ERA", "BB", "OPS", "HR", 
         "RS.", "E", "Rdrs", "playoffs")
mlb_logit$playoffs <- as.numeric(as.character(mlb_logit$playoffs))
mlb_logit$fold <- sample(rep(1:k, length.out = nrow(mlb_logit)))

mspe_vals_logit <- numeric(k)

#  k-fold cv
for (i in 1:k) {
  train_data_logit <- mlb_logit %>% filter(fold != i)
  test_data_logit <- mlb_logit %>% filter(fold == i)
  
  # fit 
  logit_base <- glm(playoffs ~ SB + PAge + BatAge + EV + ERA + BB + 
                      OPS + HR + RS. + E + Rdrs,
                    data = train_data_logit, family = "binomial")
  
  # predict on test set
  test_data_logit$predicted_prob <- predict(logit_base, newdata = test_data_logit, type = "response")
  
  
  test_data_logit$mspe <- (test_data_logit$predicted_prob - test_data_logit$playoffs)^2
  mspe_vals_logit[i] <- mean(test_data_logit$mspe)
}

logit_mspe <- sqrt(mean(mspe_vals_logit))
cat("Logit Regression MSPE:", logit_mspe, "\n")
```

**Results:**\
The baseline model exhibits an MSPE of approximately 30%, indicating
moderate predictive accuracy. However, improvements are expected using
machine learning techniques. Thus, it provides an initial understanding
of playoff predictors. By incorporating advanced techniques like ridge
regression, LASSO, and PCA, we aim to enhance predictive accuracy.
Regularization methods address overfitting risks while highlighting key
predictors for success. Future steps include incorporating additional
variables (e.g., team budgets and time-fixed effects) to refine the
model.

#### **Regularization Techniques**

To prevent overfitting, ridge and lasso regression techniques are used.
These methods identify the most important predictors while minimizing
prediction error.

```{r}
library(glmnet)

# ridge 
ridge <- glmnet(as.matrix(normalized_mlb[predictors]), normalized_mlb$playoffs, 
                alpha = 0, family = "binomial")
cv_ridge <- cv.glmnet(as.matrix(normalized_mlb[predictors]), 
                      normalized_mlb$playoffs, alpha = 0, family = "binomial")
ridge_lambda <- cv_ridge$lambda.min
ridge_coeff <- predict(ridge, s = ridge_lambda, type = "coefficients")

# LASSO
lasso <- glmnet(as.matrix(normalized_mlb[predictors]), 
                normalized_mlb$playoffs, alpha = 1, family = "binomial")
cv_lasso <- cv.glmnet(as.matrix(normalized_mlb[predictors]), 
                      normalized_mlb$playoffs, alpha = 1, family = "binomial")
lasso_lambda <- cv_lasso$lambda.min
lasso_coeff <- predict(lasso, s = lasso_lambda, type = "coefficients")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Model Comparison**

Cross-validation is used to compare the performance of the baseline,
ridge, and lasso models. Metrics such as Mean Squared Prediction Error
(MSPE) and Root Mean Squared Prediction Error (RMSPE) are calculated for
each model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

PCA is used to reduce dimensionality by identifying combinations of
predictors that explain the most variance.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(normalized_mlb[predictors], center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)
explained_variance <- cumsum(pca$sdev^2 / sum(pca$sdev^2))
num_components <- which(explained_variance >= 0.95)[1]

cat("Number of components explaining 95% variance:", num_components, "\n")
```

The reason PCA is not working well here is that the current data we have
does not explain enough of the variance with just a select few
predictors such that it is hard to remove anyone. The predective power
is low to begin with, so we need to add other predictors of interest
like budget and time fixed effects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Conclusion**

The insights and models developed throughout this project lay the
groundwork for understanding how team metrics influence playoff success
and for predicting future outcomes in the MLB. While our initial models
capture key predictors and trends, there are several opportunities to
enhance and expand this analysis.

#### **Summary of Key Findings**

1.  **EDA Insights:**
    -   Significant differences exist between playoff and non-playoff
        teams across metrics such as On-Base Percentage (OPS), Home Run
        Percentage (HR%), and Defensive Runs Saved (RDRS).
    -   Metrics reflecting offensive and defensive balance, such as Run
        Support Percentage (RS%) and Earned Run Average (ERA), are
        critical for distinguishing successful teams.
2.  **Hypothesis Testing:**
    -   Intentional Bases on Balls (IBBs) may be an indirect indicator
        of team offensive strength rather than a direct contributor to
        win-loss percentage.
    -   After controlling for On-Base Percentage (OBP) and Runs Allowed
        per Game (RA/G), IBB loses significance, suggesting it reflects
        contextual team dynamics rather than being a driver of success.
3.  **Playoff Format Changes:**
    -   The expanded playoff format provides opportunities for
        lower-seeded teams, such as the 6th seed, to outperform
        expectations.
    -   A linear model framework shows potential for studying systematic
        differences in playoff outcomes under varying formats, though
        additional seasons are needed for robust analysis.
4.  **Predictive Models:**
    -   A baseline logit model, ridge regression, and lasso regression
        show the importance of advanced metrics alongside traditional
        baseball statistics.
    -   Regularization techniques slightly improve prediction accuracy
        but highlight the need for additional context-specific
        predictors (e.g., budget, player injuries).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Broader Implications**

The findings from this project are not limited to baseball. They
demonstrate the power of statistical modeling and machine learning in
sports analytics, with potential applications across industries: -
**Sports Management:** Informing decisions on roster construction,
trades, and free-agent acquisitions. - **Fan Engagement:** Providing
deeper insights into team performance and playoff predictions. -
**General Analytics:** Highlighting the importance of balancing
substantive knowledge with data-driven techniques in decision-making.

By continuing to refine these models and expanding the scope of
analysis, this project has the potential to provide actionable insights
for teams, analysts, and fans alike.
